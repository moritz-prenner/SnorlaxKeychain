# SnorlaxKeychain
A blinking and vibrating Snorlax made out of a PCB.
## Schematic
The schematic is a simple electrical circuit powered by a 3V battery. In total there are 6 LED's and 6 220 Ohm resistors. To power on the vibrating Motor and the LED's you just have to press and hold the one and only button. The button lets electricity enter the gate pin of the NPN transistor. That let's the electricity flow from the collector to the emmiter and from there to the LED's and the Motor.
